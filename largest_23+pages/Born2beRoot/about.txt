ğŸ§­ Summary (Short)

The Born2beroot project is about creating and securing a virtual machine using Debian or Rocky Linux.
Students must configure:

A secure partition scheme, strong password policies, and UFW firewall.

SSH access (port 4242) and Sudo with restricted rights.

AppArmor (Debian) or SELinux (Rocky) for process-level security.
They must also:

Create users and groups properly.

Build and explain a monitoring script that displays system data every 10 minutes.

Understand differences between apt vs aptitude, LightDM vs AppArmor, LVM, and virtualization concepts.

The defense focuses on:

System setup â€” hostname, partitions, and configuration correctness.

Security & services â€” SSH, Sudo, UFW, password policies.

Monitoring & theory â€” explaining LVM, AppArmor, and virtualization.

Q: What is the difference between apt and aptitude?
A: Both are package managers, but aptitude has a text-based interface and smarter dependency resolution, while apt is simpler and more direct.

ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 6.

Q: What is LVM and why is it used?
A: LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows flexible disk management, enabling resizing, adding, or removing partitions without unmounting.

ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 7.

Q: What is the role of /etc/sudoers file?
A: It defines which users can execute commands as root and under what conditions.

ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 8.

Q: What is the function of the monitoring script in Born2beroot?
A: It displays system information (CPU, RAM, disk usage, IP, etc.) every 10 minutes to help monitor the machine.

ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 9.

Q: How is password policy enforced in Born2beroot?
A: Through configuration files (/etc/login.defs and PAM modules) defining minimum length, complexity, and expiration rules.

ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 10.

Q: What is the main difference between AppArmor and SELinux?
A: AppArmor uses path-based access control (Debian), while SELinux uses label-based control (Rocky Linux).
