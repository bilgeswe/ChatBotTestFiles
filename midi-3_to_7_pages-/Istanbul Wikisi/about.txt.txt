Summary of Istanbul

Istanbul is Turkey’s largest city, with over 15 million people, and serves as the country's economic, cultural, and historical hub. The city spans two continents—Europe and Asia—divided by the Bosphorus Strait. Its strategic location along waterways, trade routes, and rail networks historically made it a center of commerce, religion, and culture.

Founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists around the 7th century BCE, the city became Constantinople under Roman Emperor Constantine in 330 AD and later served as the capital of the Byzantine, Latin, and Ottoman Empires. It played a crucial role in Christianity before becoming a major Islamic city after Ottoman conquest in 1453 under Mehmed II.

The city has undergone extensive urban development and modernization throughout its history, including grand palaces, mosques, markets, and transport networks. Today, Istanbul is a global city contributing about 30% to Turkey’s economy, housing two international airports, major ports, universities, and thriving sports and cultural activities. Despite modern advances, it remains vulnerable to earthquakes due to its proximity to the North Anatolian Fault.

The city has had several names—Byzantium, Constantinople, and finally Istanbul—reflecting its long and diverse history. Its historical peninsula has been settled since the Neolithic era, making Istanbul one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.
